## Managing Permissions and Groups

This Django app implements permissions and groups to manage access to various parts of the application.

### Custom Permissions

We defined custom permissions for the `BlogPost` model:
- `can_view`: Can view a blog post.
- `can_create`: Can create a new blog post.
- `can_edit`: Can edit an existing blog post.
- `can_delete`: Can delete a blog post.

### Groups and Permissions

We have created three groups:
- **Editors**: Can create, edit, and view blog posts.
- **Viewers**: Can only view blog posts.
- **Admins**: Can view, create, edit, and delete blog posts.

### Views and Permission Enforcement

The following views are protected by the respective permissions:
- **create_blog_post**: Requires `can_create` permission.
- **edit_blog_post**: Requires `can_edit` permission.
- **delete_blog_post**: Requires `can_delete` permission.
- **view_blog_post**: Requires `can_view` permission.

### Testing

- Create users and assign them to the appropriate groups.
- Test the functionality by logging in as different users and verifying that the correct permissions are enforced.
